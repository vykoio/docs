# Vyko API Documentation

V2 Docs are on the way with server status endpoints.

We've made this open source incase some people wonder how some things were acheived with [Docusarus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) or you've spotted a typo and are so kind as to fix it for us.

You can find all pages within the `docs/` directory.
